# Online Rain/Snow Removal from Surveillance Videos

This paper proposes a new online rain/snow removal method from surveillance videos by fully encoding the dynamic statistics of both rain/snow and background scenes in a video along time into the model, and realizing it with an online mode to make it potentially available to handle constantly coming streaming video sequence.
